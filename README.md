# Advanced Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure
Advanced Serverless Architectures with Microsoft Azure redefines your experience of designing serverless systems. It shows you how to tackle challenges of varying levels, not just the straightforward ones. You'll be learning how to deliver features quickly by building systems, which retain the scalability and benefits of serverless.
You'll begin your journey by learning how to build a simple, completely serverless application. Then, you'll build a highly scalable solution using a queue, load messages onto the queue, and read them asynchronously. To boost your knowledge further, the course also features durable functions and ways to use them to solve errors in a complex system. You'll then learn about security by building a security solution from serverless components. Next, you’ll gain an understanding of observability and ways to leverage application insights to bring you performance benefits. As you approach the concluding lessons, you’ll explore chaos engineering and the benefits of resilience, by actively switching off a few of the functions within a complex system, submitting a request, and observing the resulting behavior. 
By the end of this course, you will have developed the skills you need to build and maintain increasingly complex systems that match evolving platform requirements.



## What you will learn
* Understand what true serverless architecture is
* Study how to extend and scale architectures until they become ‘complex'
* Implement durable functions in your design
* Improve the observability of your serverless architecture
* Implement security solutions using serverless services
* Learn how to ‘practise' chaos engineering in production



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i3 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 4 GB RAM
* **Storage**: 1 GB available hard disk space


### Software requirements
You’ll also need the following software installed in advance:

* OS: Any desktop Linux version or macOS, or Windows 10.
* Browser: Use one of the latest browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, or IE11, for example.
